# Automated-ROBLOX-Bot
This is a Completely automated walk bot for ROBLOX!

## How to use

To use this script you need a executor and this script.

the vector3 values in this script are for the game called "A literal baseplate". (You can use your own Vector3 values.)

It acts as a antiafk script.

But, this is undetected and will not give players any suspicion.
Its very unlikely they would think you are a bot with this script.
This is a cool script because instead of teleporting to CFrame coordinates,
You walk instead of teleporting!

## Things you need to know.
Here are some things you need to know when using this script.
 * the player or bot cant be too far away from its location

i think thats it.

## How to change the bots location to visit.
To change the location the bot visits first goto line 24.
To find the position of the location you want to go.
Use something Infinite yield and use the command "notifyposition".
This will give you the position you are at. Now you did this,
you should have atleast your starting position and the destination or finish.
then in line 24, you paste or type the position in and the bot will goto the destination.
